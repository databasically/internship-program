* Today I learned some Git features, forking and pull requests. Forking creates a duplicate of the repository that can be written to, and pull requests send a request to the original owner of the repository to merge in the changes made in the other branches.
* Today I learned about keyword arguments in Ruby. These allow the caller to omit them as they have a default value as well as call them by name with their keyword.
