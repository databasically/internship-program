* Today I learned about callbacks. Callbacks are hooks into an object's life cycle that allow you to run logic before or after key events, e.g. before an object is saved, or after it is created. Being able to hook into an object's life cycle like this is useful in controlling the flow of an object or keeping related objects up to date.
