# Today I Learned
**6-6-2013**
* Today I learned about Test Driven Development. This is a process for developing applications in a goal oriented way focused on user stories. This helps with refactoring in the future as well.
* Today I learned about the shovel operator in Rbuy (<<). This operator adds to the end of objects in Ruby, and is preferred for use in strings, when compared to plus equals (+=), as it does not create new objects to alter the string. This leads faster and more efficient use of resources when appending to a string.
* Today I learned some universal OSX shortcuts, CMD + Space to access the spotlight and run operations form there, and CMD + , in many programs to access the preferences where applicable.
