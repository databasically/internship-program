* Today I learned much about Ruby code styling. Knowing the formatting and styling guidelines chosen by the community and conforming to them allows for my code to be easily read by other developers.
* Today I learned how to set up Guard to watch for changes to my project files. Guard has many plugins available from compiling CoffeeScript when it is changed to reloading a page when its view is changed. This makes for a more streamlined and automated working enviornment.
